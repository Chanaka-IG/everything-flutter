# Everything Flutter 
Hey guys,
We are team AsyncIO and we made Everything Flutter just for you!

So what is the significance of Everything Flutter?
Unlike any platform, Everything Flutter provides you with every kind of support you need to become a pro in Flutter. You may be a beginner, Intermediate or even maybe an expert, you can benefit a lot using Everything Flutter.

Our main approach is to use "For developers by developers" as much as possible. So if you are an expert, you can help people with your knowledge writing articles, answering questions etc, and all the others can benefit from your knowledge as well.

And we are planing to launch a fully functioning platform as soon as possible! And the best part is.... It's open source!

You can see what we came up with during  [#Hack19](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/hack19?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG)  here.

See you on the other side.
Godspeed!

Flutter is Google's mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces
on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by
developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

## About Flutter

We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive,
extensible and open development model.

We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being
forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.
Flutter's [layered architecture] gives you control over every pixel on the
screen, and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate
graphics, video, text and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full
[set of widgets][widget catalog] that deliver pixel-perfect experiences on both
iOS and Android.

Flutter is fast. It's powered by the same hardware-accelerated [Skia] 2D
graphics library that underpins Chrome and Android. We architected Flutter to
support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.
Flutter code is powered by the world-class [Dart platform], which enables
compilation to native 32-bit and 64-bit ARM code for iOS and Android.

Flutter offers stateful hot reload, allowing you to make changes to your code
and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.
